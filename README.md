# LinkedList_Project_AutoTest
LinkedList Project Auto Testing Suite

This repository contains the auto test suite for the LinkedList Project
using the GitHub Classroom autograding capabilities.

The strategy is to install this repository into the student's submitted repository for testing.
To prevent overrides of the code by students, the **LinkedList_Project** repository should have a
**.gitignore** file that includes the pattern "*AutoTest*", but the **.gitignore** file for
this repository (**LinkedList_AutoTest**) should **not** contain that pattern.

To configure the autograding in Git Hub Classroom,
see Excel spreadsheet AutoTest_gitclassroom_tests.xlsx.
